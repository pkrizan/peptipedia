<div class="prose">
  # Editorial Policy

Peptipedia is a research-oriented knowledge base that summarizes information reported in scientific literature. Our goal is to present material in a way that is **accurate, traceable, and easy to review**, while avoiding medical advice or individualized recommendations.

> **Not medical advice:** Peptipedia does not provide medical guidance. Information is provided for educational and research purposes only.

---

## Scope and intent

Peptipedia content focuses on:
- Peptides and peptide-like therapeutics (and closely related agents where relevant)
- Mechanisms of action and target biology
- Clinical trial evidence (with emphasis on human randomized controlled trials)
- Safety signals as reported in trials and reputable pharmacovigilance sources
- Research gaps and uncertainty

Peptipedia does **not** aim to:
- Recommend dosing, prescribing decisions, or off-label regimens
- Provide diagnosis or treatment guidance
- Replace professional medical consultation

---

## Evidence standards

We prioritize evidence by reliability and directness:

1. **Human randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**  
2. **Human observational studies** (cohort, case-control; registries)  
3. **Mechanistic / translational evidence** (human physiology, ex vivo)  
4. **Animal studies**  
5. **In vitro / preclinical-only**  

Where possible, we highlight:
- **Population** (who was studied)
- **Dose and duration** (as per protocol)
- **Endpoints** (what was measured)
- **Comparators** (placebo/active)
- **Magnitude of effect** (reported ranges, not cherry-picked outcomes)
- **Limitations** (bias, attrition, generalizability)

---

## How we write claims

We separate:
- **What the evidence shows** (reported outcomes)
- **What is plausible** (mechanistic interpretation)
- **What remains unknown** (gaps, inconsistencies)

We avoid overstating certainty. Language is calibrated to evidence strength:
- “is associated with…” (common for observational signals)
- “was observed in trials…” (for RCT-reported outcomes)
- “may / could” only when clearly marked as hypothesis or mechanistic plausibility

---

## Citations and traceability

We aim for **verifiable references**:
- PubMed IDs (PMID) when available
- DOI for papers not indexed in PubMed
- Regulatory documents (e.g., EMA/FDA) when relevant for safety and labeling
- High-quality consensus guidelines when appropriate

We avoid citing:
- Promotional materials
- Unreviewed claims without primary sources
- Anecdotal reports as evidence (may be mentioned only as “reported” and clearly labeled)

---

## Dosing and “research context” sections

When dosing appears, it is presented **only** as:
- **Reported trial protocols** (titration schedules, maintenance doses)
- **Study duration** and follow-up
- **Outcome timing** (e.g., outcomes assessed after reaching maintenance dose)

We do not present:
- Personalized dosing instructions
- “How to use” directions
- Optimization advice for non-clinical use

---

## Safety and harm minimization

Safety sections summarize:
- Common adverse events in trials
- Known class-level risks where supported by evidence
- Monitoring signals and uncertainty (when relevant)

We explicitly avoid enabling unsafe use. If content could reasonably be interpreted as instructional, we revise it toward:
- descriptive reporting
- trial-protocol context
- clear safety framing

---

## Neutrality and conflicts of interest

Peptipedia aims to be neutral and evidence-first.  
If any entry is influenced by:
- sponsorships
- financial relationships
- partnerships
- product affiliations

…this should be disclosed on the relevant page (or site-wide if applicable). Where disclosures exist, the editorial standards above still apply.

---

## Updates, corrections, and change history

Science evolves. We update content when:
- major new trials are published
- labeling/safety guidance changes
- errors are reported and verified

Corrections are handled as:
- **Rapid correction** for factual errors (citations, numbers, definitions)
- **Revision** for interpretation changes (new evidence)

If you find an issue (broken link, incorrect dose range, missing citation), please report it via the site’s contact channel or repository issues (where applicable). Include:
- page URL
- the exact statement
- the source you believe supports the correction

---

## Content style guidelines (internal)

We aim for:
- Short, high-signal paragraphs
- Clear separation of mechanism vs evidence vs safety
- Conservative phrasing with minimal speculation
- Explicit “Unknowns & research gaps” where evidence is incomplete

---

## Medical disclaimer

Peptipedia does not provide medical advice and is not a substitute for professional care. Always consult a qualified clinician for health decisions.
