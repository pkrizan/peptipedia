# About Peptipedia

Peptipedia is a research-oriented knowledge base focused on **peptides, targets, mechanisms, and clinical evidence** — without hype, miracle claims, or “biohacker says” energy.

If a statement appears here, it’s because it showed up in **scientific literature**, not because it performed well on social media.

## Why Peptipedia exists

Peptipedia started the unglamorous way:  
by doing our **own deep research on peptides**.

We expected to find:
- structured overviews
- consistent summaries of clinical trials
- clear separation between evidence, hypothesis, and speculation

Instead, we found:
- fragmented papers spread across journals
- blog posts confidently mixing mouse data with human claims
- dosing discussions without context
- very little in the way of **systematic, comparable information**

Peptipedia exists because we wanted:
- a way to **organize peptide information systematically**
- a place where trial data, mechanisms, and safety signals live together
- content that scales beyond “one peptide at a time”

In short: we built the resource we kept looking for.

## What Peptipedia is (and isn’t)

### Peptipedia *is*:
- Evidence-first
- Citation-driven
- Mechanism-aware
- Systematic in structure
- Conservative in claims
- Explicit about uncertainty

### Peptipedia is *not*:
- Medical advice
- A prescribing guide
- A “how to use peptides” manual
- A supplement store
- A replacement for a clinician (or common sense)

---

## How content is written

Every entry aims to answer a few simple questions:
- What was studied?
- In whom?
- At what dose and for how long?
- What was measured?
- What actually happened?
- What remains unclear?

If the answer is “we don’t know yet,” we say that.

If the evidence is weak, we label it.

If something sounds impressive but isn’t supported, it doesn’t make the cut.

## About the name

Yes, it’s **Peptipedia**.

No, it doesn’t know everything.

But it does know the difference between:
- “observed in a randomized trial”
- “suggested by a mouse study”
- and “someone on the internet is very sure”

## A note on safety

Peptides and biologically active compounds are not toys.

This site does not encourage experimentation, optimization, or self-directed use.  
Anything that looks like dosing is presented **only** because it appeared in a published study or ancedotal from internet's own research — not because it’s a good idea.

---

## Who is this for?

Peptipedia is built for:
- curious researchers
- people who prefer footnotes over folklore


---

## Final word

Science is slow. Biology is complicated.  
Peptipedia respects both.
