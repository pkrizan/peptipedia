## Overview
GLP-1R is an incretin hormone receptor targeted by multiple peptide agonists studied in metabolic indications.

## Mechanistic notes *(research context)*
GLP-1R activation is associated with glucose-dependent insulin secretion and appetite/satiety signaling. Effects on gastric emptying are commonly reported early in treatment in clinical studies.

## Open questions
The relative contribution of central vs peripheral mechanisms can vary by compound, dose, and study design.
