## Overview
The glucagon receptor (GCGR) is a G-protein–coupled receptor activated by glucagon and involved in the regulation of energy balance and hepatic metabolism.

GCGR has re-emerged as a therapeutic target through **multi-receptor metabolic peptides**, where its activation is balanced by incretin receptor signaling.

---

## Physiological role
GCGR activation is associated with:
- Increased **hepatic glucose production**
- Promotion of **lipolysis**
- Modulation of **energy expenditure**

The receptor is primarily expressed in the liver, with additional expression in adipose tissue and other metabolic organs.

---

## Mechanistic notes *(research context)*
While isolated GCGR activation may increase glucose levels, combination approaches incorporating GLP-1 and/or GIP receptor agonism appear to mitigate hyperglycemic effects while preserving energy expenditure benefits.

The net metabolic outcome depends on receptor balance, dose, and duration.

---

## Evidence summary
Human evidence for GCGR targeting is primarily derived from:
- Phase 2 trials of **triple and dual agonist peptides**
- Mechanistic metabolic studies evaluating energy expenditure and weight loss  

Direct clinical evidence for selective GCGR agonists remains limited.

---

## Safety considerations
No unique GCGR-specific safety signal has been consistently identified in combination therapies to date. Ongoing trials continue to monitor hepatic, glycemic, and cardiovascular parameters.
