## Overview
The glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) is an incretin hormone receptor activated by endogenous GIP. It plays a role in postprandial insulin secretion and broader metabolic regulation.

GIPR has gained renewed attention following clinical success of **dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists**, despite earlier skepticism regarding its therapeutic utility in type 2 diabetes.

---

## Physiological role
GIPR activation is associated with:
- Glucose-dependent **insulin secretion**
- Modulation of **adipose tissue metabolism**
- Potential central nervous system signaling effects

Receptor expression has been observed in pancreatic islets, adipose tissue, and selected brain regions.

---

## Mechanistic notes *(research context)*
In early metabolic disease, GIP signaling may be attenuated. Clinical studies suggest that pharmacological activation—particularly when combined with GLP-1 receptor agonism—can restore or enhance metabolic responsiveness.

The mechanistic interaction between GIPR and GLP-1R signaling remains an area of active investigation.

---

## Evidence summary
Evidence for GIPR activation is primarily derived from:
- Human randomized controlled trials of **dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists**
- Comparative studies against GLP-1–only therapies

These studies demonstrate improvements in glycemic control and weight reduction, though attribution to GIPR alone is not fully isolated.

---

## Safety considerations
No unique safety concerns specific to GIPR activation have been consistently identified in human trials. Reported adverse events align with incretin-based therapies and are typically gastrointestinal and dose-dependent.

---

## Open questions
- Independent metabolic role of selective GIPR agonism
- Central vs peripheral contributions to observed effects
- Long-term outcomes following sustained GIPR activation
- Potential for tissue-selective GIPR modulation
