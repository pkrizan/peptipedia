## Overview
The amylin receptor is a **heterodimeric receptor complex** formed by the calcitonin receptor in combination with receptor activity–modifying proteins (RAMPs).

It mediates the physiological effects of amylin on **satiety, gastric motility, and glucagon regulation**, and is a key target for amylin analogue therapies.

---

## Physiological role
Amylin receptor activation is associated with:
- **Meal termination and satiety**
- Delayed **gastric emptying**
- Suppression of **postprandial glucagon secretion**

Receptor activity is particularly prominent in the **area postrema and brainstem**, regions involved in appetite and nausea signaling.

## Mechanistic notes *(research context)*
Unlike classical single-protein receptors, amylin receptors exist as multiple receptor complexes depending on RAMP composition. This contributes to:
- Functional diversity in signaling  
- Tissue-specific responses  
- Complexity in pharmacological targeting  

Amylin analogue therapies are designed to activate these receptor complexes in a controlled and sustained manner.

---

## Evidence summary
Evidence for amylin receptor targeting in humans includes:
- Randomized trials demonstrating reduced food intake and body weight
- Improvements in satiety-related behavioral endpoints
- Consistent findings across monotherapy and combination studies  

The strongest evidence base exists in obesity and metabolic disease populations.

## Safety considerations
Adverse events associated with amylin receptor activation primarily reflect:
- Central nausea signaling
- Gastrointestinal motility changes  

These effects are typically transient and dose-related in clinical trials.

## Open questions
- Differential signaling across amylin receptor subtypes  
- Central vs peripheral contributions to observed effects  
- Long-term neuroadaptation with sustained activation  
- Potential for receptor-selective modulation
