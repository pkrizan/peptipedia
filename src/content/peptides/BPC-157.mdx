## Overview
BPC-157 is a synthetic pentadecapeptide (15 amino acids) derived from a sequence reported from gastric sources in preclinical literature. It is widely discussed for tissue repair applications, but the evidence base is dominated by **animal and preclinical studies**, with **minimal controlled human efficacy data**.

## Mechanism of action
<ClaimCallout
  claim="BPC-157 shows cytoprotective and tissue-repair–associated effects in multiple animal injury models."
  evidence="animal"
  confidence="medium"
  citations={["PMCID:PMC12313605"]}
 />

Proposed mechanisms in the literature include modulation of:
- nitric oxide signaling
- angiogenesis and growth-factor pathways
- inflammatory signaling cascades

These are largely based on preclinical and mechanistic studies rather than definitive target-specific human pharmacology. 

<ClaimCallout
  claim="Cell/ex vivo studies suggest effects on tendon fibroblast behavior relevant to healing hypotheses."
  evidence="in_vitro"
  confidence="low"
  citations={["DOI:10.1152/japplphysiol.00945.2010"]}

## Evidence summary
### What is strong
- **Preclinical breadth:** numerous rodent models across musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal injury contexts 

### What is limited
- **Human efficacy evidence:** limited; controlled human RCTs for musculoskeletal healing are not established in the mainstream literature 

### What exists in humans
<ClaimCallout
  claim="A very small human safety report (n=2) described tolerability of intravenous BPC-157 without observed adverse effects in that pilot setting."
  evidence="case_report"
  confidence="low"
  citations={["PMID:40131143"]}
 />
This does not establish clinical efficacy and should be interpreted as early safety-only signal generation.

## Safety & known risks
Human safety data remain limited.

Key uncertainty areas include:
- long-term safety in humans
- pharmacokinetics and metabolism across administration routes
- product quality variability outside regulated manufacturing

Reviews emphasize that popularity and availability exceed the maturity of the human evidence base.

## 🔬 Clinical & observational context *(research-oriented)*

> **Important:** This section summarizes information reported in scientific literature and does not constitute medical advice.

### Reported dosing ranges (research context)
A robust, comparable human trial dosing literature is not established. Reported regimens in non-trial contexts are heterogeneous and should not be treated as evidence.

### Observed effects (what the literature actually supports)
- Tissue repair signals are largely derived from **animal models** (muscle, tendon/ligament, GI) 
- Human clinical efficacy remains **unconfirmed** at scale 

### Anecdotal claims
Anecdotal reports exist in community settings, but they are not reliable evidence and are intentionally separated from scientific findings.

## Unknowns & research gaps
- Lack of large, well-controlled human efficacy trials
- Unclear dose–exposure relationships in humans
- Mechanistic attribution to specific receptor targets is not established
