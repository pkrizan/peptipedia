## Overview
Tesamorelin is a synthetic **growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue** that stimulates endogenous growth hormone (GH) secretion and increases insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).

It is approved in the United States for the **reduction of excess abdominal fat in HIV-infected adults with lipodystrophy**, with explicit labeling that it is **not indicated for weight loss management**.

## Mechanism of action
<ClaimCallout
  claim="GHRH receptor agonism increases endogenous GH secretion and raises circulating IGF-1 levels."

  confidence="high"

 />

Tesamorelin binds the **GHRH receptor** on pituitary somatotroph cells, increasing GH secretion and downstream IGF-1 production.

## Evidence summary
In randomized controlled trials in people living with HIV and central fat accumulation, tesamorelin was associated with:
- **Reduced visceral adipose tissue (VAT)** (often reported on the order of ~15–20% relative reduction over ~26 weeks) 
- Improvements in select **lipid parameters** in some studies 
- Weight effects described as **weight neutral** in labeling; it is **not indicated for weight loss management** 

A JAMA study reported reductions in VAT and **modest reductions in liver fat** over 6 months in a specific HIV population. 

---

## Safety & known risks
Across trials and labeling, key safety considerations include:
- **IGF-1 elevation** (monitoring recommended in labeling) 
- **Glucose intolerance/diabetes risk** (evaluate glucose before and during therapy per label) 
- **Fluid retention** symptoms (e.g., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome) 
- **Contraindications** include active malignancy, pregnancy, and disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis

## 🔬 Clinical & observational context *(research-oriented)*

> **Important:** This section summarizes information reported in scientific literature and does not constitute medical advice.

### Reported dosing ranges (research context)
Trial regimens and commercial formulations differ by product version:
- In pivotal trials, tesamorelin was administered **once daily subcutaneously** for **26 weeks**, often followed by an extension phase. 
- Current FDA labeling for **EGRIFTA WR** describes **1.28 mg subcutaneously once daily** (specific to the WR formulation). 
- Earlier formulations (e.g., EGRIFTA SV) used different vial strengths and recommended dosing (see formulation-specific labeling). 

### What “worked” in trials (endpoint-specific)
In HIV-associated lipodystrophy trials, efficacy was primarily demonstrated as:
- **Reduction in visceral adipose tissue** (VAT) after ~**26 weeks** of daily dosing 

Importantly, tesamorelin is described as **not indicated for weight loss management**; observed benefits are focused on **VAT** rather than scale weight. 

### Typical study duration
- Major RCTs: **26-week** randomized phase + **extension** in some programs 
- Additional mechanistic/organ-fat outcomes reported at **~6 months** in specific studies 

---

## Unknowns & research gaps
- Long-term cardiovascular outcome impact remains **not established** in labeling 
- Durability of VAT reduction after discontinuation
- Broader generalizability beyond HIV-associated lipodystrophy populations
