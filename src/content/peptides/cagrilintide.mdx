## Overview
Cagrilintide is a long-acting **amylin analogue** developed to mimic and extend the physiological effects of endogenous amylin, a peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic beta cells.

It has been evaluated in human randomized controlled trials for obesity and weight management, both as **monotherapy** and in **combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists**.

## Mechanism of action
<ClaimCallout
  claim="Amylin receptor agonism is associated with reduced appetite, delayed gastric emptying, and decreased food intake in humans."
  evidence="human_rct"
  confidence="high"
/>

Amylin signaling influences energy balance through:
- **Central appetite regulation** via hindbrain and hypothalamic pathways  
- **Delayed gastric emptying**, contributing to early satiety  
- Modulation of **postprandial glucagon secretion**  

Cagrilintide is engineered to provide **prolonged receptor activation**, enabling once-weekly administration in clinical studies.

---

## Evidence summary
Human randomized trials demonstrate that cagrilintide produces **dose-dependent body-weight reduction** in adults with overweight or obesity.

Key findings across studies include:
- Clinically meaningful weight loss with cagrilintide monotherapy  
- Enhanced weight reduction when **combined with GLP-1 receptor agonists**  
- Improvements in appetite control and eating behavior measures  

The combination approach reflects complementary mechanisms between **amylin** and **incretin** signaling.

---

## Safety & known risks
Across clinical trials, cagrilintide demonstrated a **tolerability profile consistent with other appetite-regulating peptides**.

Commonly reported adverse events include:
- Nausea  
- Vomiting  
- Reduced appetite  

These effects were:
- Generally dose-dependent  
- Most frequent during initiation and titration  
- Typically mild to moderate in severity  

No major safety signal distinct from known amylin biology has been consistently identified to date.

## 🔬 Clinical & observational context *(research-oriented)*

> **Important:** This section summarizes information reported in scientific literature and does not constitute medical advice.

### Reported dosing ranges and titration (research context)
In phase 2 trials, cagrilintide was evaluated at **multiple once-weekly dose levels**, following **gradual dose escalation** protocols.

Lower doses were used during initiation to improve gastrointestinal tolerability, with efficacy assessed after participants reached assigned maintenance doses.

---

### Observed effects and timelines
Across obesity-focused trials:
- **Weight reduction** was observed during titration and increased over time  
- Greater effects were associated with **higher maintenance doses**  
- Combination studies reported **additive weight loss** compared with GLP-1 receptor agonist monotherapy  

Most trials followed participants for **26–68 weeks**, depending on study design.

---

### Combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists
Cagrilintide has been studied in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g. semaglutide), based on complementary mechanisms:
- Amylin signaling primarily affects **satiety and meal termination**
- GLP-1 signaling influences **appetite, insulin secretion, and gastric emptying**

Combination therapy has been associated with **greater mean weight loss** than either agent alone in clinical studies.

---

## Unknowns & research gaps
Despite encouraging trial data, several questions remain:
- Long-term durability of weight loss after discontinuation  
- Optimal positioning of amylin analogues relative to incretin-based therapies  
- Inter-individual variability in response  
- Long-term safety beyond current trial durations  

Further phase 3 data are required to clarify these aspects.
