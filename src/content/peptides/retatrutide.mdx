## Overview
Retatrutide is a synthetic peptide designed as a **triple agonist** of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor, and glucagon receptor (GCGR).

It has been evaluated in early-phase human randomized controlled trials for metabolic indications, particularly obesity, and represents an investigational class of **multi-receptor incretin and glucagon-based therapies**.

---

## Mechanism of action
<ClaimCallout
  claim="Simultaneous agonism of GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors is associated with substantial body-weight reduction and metabolic effects in humans."
  evidence="human_rct"
  confidence="medium"
  />

Retatrutide engages three distinct but metabolically interconnected receptors:
- **GLP-1R**, associated with appetite regulation, glucose-dependent insulin secretion, and delayed gastric emptying  
- **GIPR**, involved in postprandial insulin secretion and broader metabolic modulation  
- **GCGR**, which influences energy expenditure, lipid metabolism, and hepatic glucose output  

The combined receptor profile is hypothesized to balance **appetite suppression**, **insulinotropic effects**, and **increased energy expenditure**, though the precise contribution of each receptor remains under investigation.

---

## Evidence summary
Evidence for retatrutide is currently derived from **phase 2 human randomized controlled trials**.

Published studies report:
- **Pronounced, dose-dependent body-weight reduction**, exceeding that observed in earlier incretin-only therapies  
- Improvements in **glycemic markers**, including fasting glucose and HbA1c  
- Favorable changes in select **cardiometabolic parameters**, such as waist circumference and lipid markers  

Direct head-to-head comparisons with other incretin therapies are limited, and long-term outcome data are not yet available.

---

## Safety & known risks
Across reported trials, retatrutide demonstrated a **tolerability profile broadly consistent with incretin-based therapies**, with additional considerations related to glucagon receptor activation.

Commonly reported adverse events include:
- Nausea  
- Vomiting  
- Diarrhea  
- Decreased appetite  

These effects were:
- Dose-dependent  
- Most frequent during titration phases  
- Generally mild to moderate in severity  

No definitive glucagon-specific safety signal has been established to date, though ongoing monitoring is warranted.

## 🔬 Clinical & observational context *(research-oriented)*

> **Important:** This section summarizes information reported in scientific literature and does not constitute medical advice.

### Reported dosing ranges and titration (research context)
In the Phase 3 TRIUMPH program, retatrutide is evaluated as a once-weekly subcutaneous therapy with protocol-defined maintenance doses. In the standalone osteoarthritis trial **TRIUMPH-4 (NCT05931367)**, participants are randomized to **retatrutide 9 mg, retatrutide 12 mg, or placebo**. 

TRIUMPH studies use a **fixed dose-escalation regimen** to reach the assigned maintenance dose. In the TRIUMPH program, this is described as a **16-week dose escalation period** followed by a longer maintenance period (trial-specific). 
**TRIUMPH-4 duration:** **68 weeks** of treatment plus a short safety follow-up period. 

---

### Reported weight-loss outcomes (research context)
> **Note:** Some Phase 3 results are currently available as **topline / press-reported outcomes** and may be updated when full peer-reviewed publications become available.

In reported topline Phase 3 results for **TRIUMPH-4 (68 weeks)** in adults with overweight/obesity and knee osteoarthritis, the **12 mg** group was reported to achieve **~28.7% mean body-weight reduction** (≈ **71.2 lb** on average), with additional improvements reported in osteoarthritis pain outcomes. 

TRIUMPH-4’s co-primary endpoints include **percent change in body weight** and **change in WOMAC pain subscale score**, both assessed at **Week 68**.
---

### Health markers and secondary outcomes tracked in TRIUMPH trials
Across the TRIUMPH program design, key secondary outcomes include:
- Weight-loss responder thresholds (e.g., **≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, ≥25%**, and in some trials **≥30%**)  
- **Waist circumference**  
- **Blood pressure** and **lipid parameters**  
- Biomarkers of **insulin sensitivity** and **inflammation** (including **hsCRP**)   
- Measures of **quality of life** (e.g., SF-36v2) 


---

### Observed effects and timelines
Across studies:
- **Weight reduction** was observed during titration and continued through maintenance  
- Maximal weight outcomes were assessed after **longer-term exposure**  
- Glycemic and metabolic changes tracked with dose and duration  

Most published trials followed participants for **up to ~48 weeks**, with longer-term data pending.

**Evidence floor:** Anecdotal  
**Confidence:** Low  
**Sources:** Aggregated Reddit discussion threads and community reports  
**Population:** Self-experimenting adults (non-controlled, non-verified)

---

### Reported dosing patterns (non-clinical)

Across multiple Reddit threads and long-form user logs, the following **patterns are most frequently mentioned**:

#### Starting doses (most common)
- **0.25–0.5 mg once weekly**  
  Often described as a “tolerance check” phase.

#### Titration approaches
- Gradual increases every **2–4 weeks**
- Typical step-ups reported:  
  **0.25 → 0.5 → 1.0 mg weekly**

#### Upper ranges mentioned
- **1.5–3.0 mg weekly** reported by a minority of users  
- Higher doses are less common and more frequently associated with side effects

> Many users explicitly report **not increasing dose** if appetite suppression or weight loss is already present.

---

### Dosing frequency (reported)
- **Once weekly** dosing is overwhelmingly dominant
- Very few anecdotal mentions of split or more frequent dosing  
  *(often followed by reports of worse tolerability)*

---


### Studied or hypothesised interactions
Retatrutide is frequently discussed in the context of:
- Comparison with dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists  
- Theoretical advantages of incorporating **glucagon receptor agonism**  
- Development of next-generation multi-receptor metabolic peptides  

The balance between glucagon-mediated energy expenditure and glycemic control remains a central research focus.

---

## Unknowns & research gaps
Key open questions include:
- Long-term safety and tolerability  
- Durability of weight loss after discontinuation  
- Optimal balance of triple receptor activation  
- Inter-individual variability in response  

Retatrutide remains investigational, and additional phase 3 data are required to clarify these aspects.
