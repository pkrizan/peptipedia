## Overview
Amylin analogues are peptide-based therapeutics designed to mimic the physiological actions of **amylin**, a peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic beta cells.

This class has been studied in human randomized controlled trials for metabolic indications, particularly **obesity and weight management**, and is increasingly explored in **combination with incretin-based therapies**.

---

## Biological role of amylin
Endogenous amylin is released alongside insulin in response to food intake and contributes to postprandial metabolic regulation by:
- Promoting **satiety and meal termination**
- **Delaying gastric emptying**
- Suppressing **postprandial glucagon secretion**

Unlike incretin hormones, amylin’s primary role is not insulin secretion but **central regulation of appetite and food intake**.

## Mechanism of action
<ClaimCallout
  claim="Amylin receptor agonism is associated with reduced appetite, delayed gastric emptying, and decreased caloric intake in humans."
  evidence="human_rct"
  confidence="high"
/>

Amylin analogues activate amylin-responsive receptor complexes in the brainstem and hypothalamus, influencing:
- Central satiety signaling  
- Meal size reduction  
- Gastrointestinal motility  

Modern analogues are engineered to:
- Improve stability and half-life  
- Reduce aggregation risk seen with native amylin  
- Enable **long-acting or once-weekly dosing** in clinical studies  

---

## Evidence summary
Human randomized trials support the role of amylin analogues in:
- **Dose-dependent body-weight reduction**
- Reduced appetite and food intake
- Improvements in eating behavior metrics

When studied in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists, amylin analogues have demonstrated **additive or synergistic weight-loss effects**, consistent with complementary mechanisms of action.

---

## Safety and tolerability (class-level)
Across clinical trials, amylin analogues have shown a **predictable and class-consistent tolerability profile**.

Commonly reported adverse events include:
- Nausea  
- Vomiting  
- Reduced appetite  

These effects are typically:
- Dose-dependent  
- Most prominent during initiation or titration  
- Mild to moderate in severity  

No distinct long-term safety signal unique to the class has been consistently identified to date.

## Clinical and research context
> **Important:** This section summarizes findings from scientific literature and does not constitute medical advice.

### Role in combination therapies
Amylin analogues are frequently investigated in combination with:
- GLP-1 receptor agonists
- Other appetite-regulating agents

This reflects their complementary role in **satiety and meal termination**, compared with incretin effects on glucose regulation and appetite modulation.

---

## Limitations and open questions
Despite encouraging data, several questions remain:
- Long-term durability of effects after discontinuation  
- Optimal positioning relative to incretin-based therapies  
- Inter-individual variability in response  
- Long-term safety beyond current trial durations
