## Overview
Immune-modulating peptides are a class of biologically active peptides that influence **innate and adaptive immune responses**, often by enhancing immune coordination rather than directly stimulating cytokine release.

This class includes peptides studied in **human randomized controlled trials** for infectious diseases, immune deficiency, and adjunct cancer therapy.

## Mechanistic principles
<ClaimCallout
  claim="Immune-modulating peptides can enhance immune responsiveness while preserving regulatory balance in humans."
  evidence="human_rct"
  confidence="high"
/>

Unlike broad immune stimulants, these peptides typically:
- Promote **immune maturation and coordination**
- Enhance **host response to pathogens**
- Improve **immune surveillance**
- Avoid persistent immune overactivation

---

## Evidence summary
Human clinical studies demonstrate that immune-modulating peptides may:
- Improve outcomes as **adjunct therapies**
- Enhance antiviral and antibacterial defense
- Support immune recovery in compromised states

Their effects are generally **context-specific** and dependent on underlying immune status.

## Safety and tolerability
Across trials, immune-modulating peptides show:
- Generally good tolerability
- Low incidence of serious immune-related adverse events
- Favorable safety profiles compared with systemic immune stimulants

---

## Representative compounds
- Thymosin alpha-1  
- Thymosin beta-4 (investigational contexts)  

---

## Open questions
- Biomarkers for responder identification
- Long-term immune recalibration effects
- Optimal integration with modern immunotherapies
