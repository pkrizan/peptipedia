## Overview
Copper peptides are peptide complexes that bind copper ions and are studied primarily in dermatologic and tissue remodeling contexts. The best-known example is **GHK-Cu**, a naturally occurring human peptide–copper complex widely used in topical skincare.

Evidence for this class is strongest in **skin/cosmetic observational and small clinical studies**, supported by extensive **in vitro** and **animal** literature.

## Mechanism of action
<ClaimCallout
  claim="Copper peptide complexes are associated with extracellular matrix remodeling pathways (collagen/elastin/proteoglycans) and MMP/TIMP regulation in skin biology research."
  evidence="human_observational"
  confidence="medium"
  citations={["PMCID:PMC6073405"]}
 />

Proposed class-level themes include:
- Modulation of **skin matrix turnover** and repair-associated signaling 
- Support of **copper bioavailability** in biochemical contexts (mechanistic hypothesis) 
- Broad transcriptomic effects reported in some datasets (interpretation remains cautious).

## Evidence summary
- Human: primarily skin appearance/photoaging endpoints and related measures in topical-use studies 
- Preclinical: extensive mechanistic and animal model work on tissue remodeling and wound healing–adjacent outcomes

## Safety & tolerability
Topical use is generally described as well tolerated in the literature, with irritation/sensitivity being the most common practical limitation. Systemic safety outside topical use is less established in high-quality clinical trials.
