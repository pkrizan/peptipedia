## Overview
GHRH analogues are peptides that activate the **growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) receptor**, stimulating endogenous GH secretion and increasing IGF-1.

This class has human randomized trial evidence in specific indications, most notably HIV-associated lipodystrophy (tesamorelin).
