## Overview
Glucagon receptor agonists are peptide-based therapies designed to activate the **glucagon receptor (GCGR)**, a key regulator of energy metabolism and hepatic glucose output.

While standalone glucagon receptor agonism historically raised concerns regarding hyperglycemia, renewed interest has emerged through **multi-receptor peptides** that combine glucagon signaling with incretin receptor activation.

## Biological role of glucagon
Endogenous glucagon is secreted by pancreatic alpha cells and plays a role in:
- Regulation of **hepatic glucose production**
- Promotion of **lipolysis**
- Modulation of **energy expenditure**

Glucagon signaling counterbalances insulin and contributes to metabolic flexibility during fasting.

Synthetic glucagon receptor agonists are engineered to:
- Engage GCGR while mitigating hyperglycemic effects  
- Balance energy expenditure with glycemic control through co-activation of incretin receptors  

This approach underpins the development of dual and triple agonist peptides.

---

## Evidence summary
Clinical evidence for glucagon receptor agonism is primarily derived from:
- Human trials of **multi-receptor peptides** (GLP-1 / glucagon; GLP-1 / GIP / glucagon)
- Early-phase studies assessing metabolic outcomes  

These studies report:
- Significant body-weight reduction  
- Increases in markers associated with energy expenditure  
- Acceptable glycemic control when combined with incretin signaling  

---

## Safety and tolerability
Safety observations indicate:
- Gastrointestinal adverse events consistent with incretin therapies  
- No consistent evidence of sustained hyperglycemia in combination approaches  

Long-term safety remains under evaluation.

## Representative compounds
- Retatrutide (GLP-1 / GIP / glucagon receptor agonist)

## Open questions
- Independent role of selective glucagon receptor agonism  
- Optimal balance between weight loss and glycemic control  
- Long-term metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes
