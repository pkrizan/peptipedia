## Overview
GIP receptor agonists are peptide-based therapeutics designed to activate the **glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor**, an incretin hormone receptor involved in postprandial insulin secretion and metabolic regulation.

Historically, GIP biology was considered less therapeutically promising than GLP-1 due to impaired responsiveness in type 2 diabetes. Renewed interest emerged with the development of **dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists**, which demonstrated substantial metabolic effects in human trials.

---

## Biological role of GIP
GIP is an incretin hormone secreted by intestinal K-cells in response to nutrient intake. In physiological settings, GIP:
- Stimulates **glucose-dependent insulin secretion**
- Influences **adipose tissue metabolism**
- Interacts with central and peripheral metabolic signaling pathways

GIP receptor expression has been identified in pancreatic islets, adipose tissue, and the central nervous system.

## Mechanism of action
<ClaimCallout

  confidence="medium"
/>

Synthetic GIP receptor agonists are engineered to:
- Resist enzymatic degradation
- Prolong receptor activation
- Enable once-weekly or long-acting administration

When combined with GLP-1 receptor agonism, GIP activation is hypothesized to **augment metabolic effects**, although the precise mechanistic contribution remains under investigation.

---

## Evidence summary
Standalone GIP receptor agonism has limited historical clinical use. However, **human randomized trials of dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists** have demonstrated:
- Robust reductions in **HbA1c**
- Significant **body-weight reduction**
- Improvements in cardiometabolic risk markers

These findings re-established GIP receptor agonism as a relevant therapeutic mechanism when integrated into multi-receptor approaches.

---

## Safety and tolerability (class-level)
Safety signals associated with GIP receptor agonism are largely derived from combination therapies.

Reported adverse events in trials are consistent with incretin-based therapies and include:
- Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
- Dose-dependent effects during titration

No unique safety signal attributable solely to GIP receptor agonism has been consistently identified to date.

## Clinical and research context
> **Important:** This section summarizes information from scientific literature and does not constitute medical advice.

### Role in multi-receptor peptides
Current clinical relevance of GIP receptor agonists is primarily within:
- **Dual agonists** (e.g. GIP/GLP-1)
- Investigational **multi-receptor incretin peptides**

The independent therapeutic role of selective GIP agonism remains an active research question.

---

## Limitations and open questions
- Relative contribution of GIP vs GLP-1 signaling in observed outcomes
- Central versus peripheral mechanisms of action
- Long-term effects following treatment discontinuation
- Potential role of selective GIP modulation in future therapies

## Representative compounds
- Tirzepatide (dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor agonist)
